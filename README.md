This will be the Record of my JavaScript Dom Learning Progress.

Currently Stopped at using Children instead of Using ChildNodes

Worked on selecting Dom Elements using the children property and Adding style to a particular one from the list or using for loop to add style to all of the elements.

Worked on selecting with firstChild property, firstElementChild property, lastChild property and lastElementChild property as well as the differences.

Will be progressing to selecting with siblings.
